# Flappy AI
This repository contains a modified version of the game "Flappy Dragon" from the book "Hands-on Rust" by Herbert Wolverson. The original source code can be found here: https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust/tree/main/FirstGameFlappyAscii/flappy_bonus.

This version can either be played by a human collecting data to train a machine learning model or by the model itself.

A Jupyter Notebook is included with code to train a Perceptron and a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
